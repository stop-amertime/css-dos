## 2026-04-28 - XLAT segment-override fix (kiln correctness)

Kiln emitted `--_xlatByte` with DS hard-coded, ignoring 0x26 / 0x2E /
0x36 / 0x3E prefix. Doom8088 column drawer uses `ss xlat` twice per
pixel for SS:BX colormap (`i_vv13ha.asm`, `i_vv13ma.asm`,
`i_vv13la.asm`, `i_vegaa.asm`, `i_vmodya.asm`, `i_vcgaa.asm`) -
every textured pixel read from DS:BX+AL. Fix: use `--directSeg`
(override-or-DS) at `kiln/decode.mjs:362`.

Verified: smoke 7 carts green; Doom8088 reaches in-game on web
(`stage_ingame` tick 34.4 M, `runMsToInGame` 110 s); gameplay frame
correct. Title splash unaffected (V_DrawRaw, no XLAT).

Also rewired smoke list - small carts moved to `carts/test-carts/`
so harness was silently running only zork+montezuma; now all 7 fire.
